# Snippets for Visual Studio on Mac
This is my little dumping ground for a collection of useful **code snippets** that can be used with Visual Studio for Mac (not on Windows, it uses different XML schema).

- `bprop` is a snippet for adding a Xamarin.Forms [BindableProperty](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/xamarin/xamarin-forms/xaml/bindable-properties) 
- `bpropc` adds a `BindableProperty` as above, but with an additional static callback for listening on PropertyChanged (with unboxing pre-filled for you).

## Installing

If you want to use these, you will need to copy the XML files into `~/Library/VisualStudio/7.0/Snippets`. 

## Contribute

If you want to modify or add your own (for some reason), raise a PR with your XML files (found in the same path as above).

Cheers!
